				Stem cells originate from two main sources: adult body tissues and embryos. Scientists are also working on ways to develop stem cells from other cells, using genetic "reprogramming" techniques.Stem cells originate from two main sources: adult body tissues and embryos.

				A person's body contains stem cells throughout their life. The body can use these stem cells whenever it needs them.Also called tissue-specific or somatic stem cells, adult stem cells exist throughout the body from the time an embryo develops.A person's body contains stem cells throughout their life.

				From the very earliest stage of pregnancy, after the sperm fertilizes the egg, an embryo forms.Around 3–5 days after a sperm fertilizes an egg, the embryo takes the form of a blastocyst or ball of cells.The blastocyst contains stem cells and will later implant in the womb. Embryonic stem cells come from a blastocyst that is 4–5 days old.From the very earliest stage of pregnancy, after the sperm fertilizes the egg, an embryo forms.Around 3–5 days after a sperm fertilizes an egg, the embryo takes the form of a blastocyst or ball of cells.
